# Vehicle management

Vehicle Management
This is a website that was created for my Django final project. It allows a company to use its vehicles effectively by assigning them to employees only when they are needed. It was developed using HTML/CSS and JS for the frontend and Django for the backend. It has two basic templates: the user's and the admin's.

It has many features, such as allowing users to request a vehicle after logging in. An officer will then assign them a driver who is available, and an email will be sent to both parties with a description of the assigned driver. After the trip is complete, the user will end the trip so that the driver will be available for another trip.

The users, officers, drivers, and vehicles are added by the admin, and conflicts such as ordering another trip while on a trip and assigning a vehicle to a driver who is already taken are dealt with.
